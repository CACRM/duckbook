Those filing Single or HoH get an additional $1,850 if 65 or older, and an additional $1,850 if blind.

  <li class="rvps9"><span class="rvts28">Because property tax bills can include items that are not real estate taxes, it’s important to </span><span class="rvts27">review the actual bills</span><span class="rvts28"> (generally available online – see above, if the taxpayer did not bring these), rather than simply enter the dollar amounts paid.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li class="rvps9"><span class="rvts28">The nondeductible amount on property tax bills is divided equally between the two payments. &nbsp;So for example, if the taxpayer paid only one of the two tax bills during the tax year, divide the nondeductible amount by two, and subtract from the payment amount, to get the amount to enter on Schedule A. &nbsp;Or, if three bills were paid during the tax year (payment #2 from the prior bill plus both halves of the current bill), there will be three halves of nondeductible payments to subtract from the total of the three payments.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps9"><span class="rvts61">Note: &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts28">As property tax totals </span><span class="rvts61">and</span><span class="rvts28"> nondeductible items usually change from year to year, technically you should </span><span class="rvts27">separately determine the deductible amount for each payment</span><span class="rvts28">, then total them for Schedule A.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps9"><span class="rvts28">Document your findings in a TaxSlayer note, per page </span><span class="rvts105">8</span><span class="rvts28">. &nbsp;For example, a note called “PROPERTY TAX” might say “Nondeduct.: $215 Sewer charge for 2022-3 payment 2, $230 for 2023-4 payment 1; Vector disease control $8 each payment; PACE.” (This would help next year’s preparer know what’s non-deductible for </span><span class="rvts61">next </span><span class="rvts28">year’s spring payment, since the taxpayer may not bring the </span><span class="rvts61">previous</span><span class="rvts28"> bill.)</span></li>
